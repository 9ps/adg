# Sensible usage of ARIA roles and attributes

**There are some ARIA roles and attributes that we use and recommend in our daily business, especially regarding JavaScript widgets. Many times, there are alternative techniques stated: if feasible, we use them instead of ARIA.**

Before you proceed, please thoroughly read [ARIA - when HTML simply is not enough](/knowledge/aria) and [Introduction to desktop screen reader usage](/knowledge/desktop-screen-readers), especially [Screen readers' browse and focus modes](/knowledge/desktop-screen-readers/browse-focus-modes)!
