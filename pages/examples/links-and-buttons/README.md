# Links and Buttons

**TODO**



## Additional notes

Whenever you submit a form, it's a button. When you simply link to another page, it's a link. When you e.g. open a dialog, I would suggest using a button, but a link is appropriate, too (you could think of a dialog box as different part of the same page, and so the element opening it could be seen as an in-page link).

Inputs, welche disabled sind, können nicht angetabbt werden! Ungünstig für Screenreader. `tabindex="0"` eine Lösung?
