      p Please tell us your name.
      p A name typically consists of a first and a last name.
      p Some people also have a middle name. Or more than one.
      p Because of that, we offer a single input here, instead of one for each kind of name.
      p Some cultures even have habits of naming that are very different to ours, so it's really hard (if not impossible) to define a offer an input mask that's working for all. This is another reason why having a single input works fine here.
