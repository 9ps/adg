# Sticky table headers

**In some situations, table headers need to be placed at a specific place on screen, and remain there, even when scrolling.**

If tables are very long, it is useful to make the table header sticky on top so visual users always see it, even when scrolling vertically.

This is also possible for horizontally scrolling tables.
