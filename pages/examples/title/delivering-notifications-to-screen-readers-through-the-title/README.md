# Delivering Notifications to Screen Readers Through the Title

****



## Additional notes

- Show that the title is a great place for notifications after a page reload!
- If there's no page reload, you can just set the focus to the displayed notification (`tabindex="-1"`, etc.)
- Sometimes an alternative is [Focus Handling](/examples/focus-handling) and [Noticing screen readers using alert role](/examples/sensible-aria-usage/alert)
