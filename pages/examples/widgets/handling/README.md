# How to handle widgets

**Widgets are custom form controls, and as such should be handled the very same way like standard form controls.**

See [How to handle forms](/examples/forms/handling).

But also:

- [Widgets simply working for all](/knowledge/semantics/widgets)
- [ARIA - when HTML simply isn't enough](/knowledge/aria)

All widgets are implemented in a way to maximise compatibility and rely on ARIA as seldom as possible. You can use "poor man's screen reader" and they should work to the highest extent possible: [Web Developer toolbar](/setup/browsers/firefox/web-developer-toolbar).
