# Examples of accessibility patterns

**There often exist various approaches to solving an accessibility requirement, but usually one specific solution stands out clearly. The chapters in this 4th part of our guide, the Examples part, contain our collection of such rock-solid and inspiring solutions. They are available as real-life code examples (ready for copy&paste), and as such can be executed and played with directly in the browser.**

## How to go through this part

First of all, before you continue reading, be sure you have gone through the previous parts already:

- [Introduction to this guide](/intro)
- [Setup of the accessibility environment](/setup)
- [Knowledge about accessibility](/knowledge)

The current part is the one you will probably head to most during your accessibility ambitions. There are a lot of topics that are relevant to pretty much every kind of website, while others maybe are not very relevant to some specific ones. For example, if the website in question doesn't offer any tabular data, then the chapter about tables probably will not be of interest at the time being.

Still, we recommend you to get at least a broad overview of all available content: you can do that by reading through the overview page of each chapter, and maybe also by skimming over the contained pages. Then, whenever during your daily workflow you stumble over a topic that you remember you spotted in our guide, we advise you to check back here and read through the respective chapter(s) thoroughly.

There's no specific sequence or internal dependency between the chapters. So every chapter can be read on its own. Whenever other chapters are related to the current one, we offer links pointing to them.

## One solution working for all

All of our examples are based on the understanding that for the very most (if not all) accessibility requirements there is one single solution that works best for all possible user profiles. Usually this boils down to the usage of plain standard HTML (spiced up with CSS and JavaScript), as described here: [Semantics and their importance for accessibility](/knowledge/semantics).

If additional optimisations for assistive devices is needed, usually some ARIA techniques are added, see [ARIA - when HTML simply isn't enough](/knowledge/aria). But we do this only with techniques that have proven to be rock solid: this means that they work in the most used browser and screen reader combinations, see [Relevant combinations of screen readers and browsers](/knowledge/desktop-screen-readers/relevant-combos), and no disturbing side effects have to be expected with other devices (like exotic or legacy software).

In one sentence: we do not provide solutions that **should** work, but solutions that **do** work.
