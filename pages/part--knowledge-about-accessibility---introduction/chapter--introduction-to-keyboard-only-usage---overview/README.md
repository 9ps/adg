Finally, we provide you with some more [basic Windows keyboard shortcuts](@page-138).

**Notice:** with "keyboard only" we mean that no screen reader is running! Because if a screen reader is running, website navigation may behave very different. So although screen readers usually are also controlled by keyboard only, we urge you not to confuse these terms.
