# Chapter: Introduction to desktop screen reader usage - overview

WE ARE ONLY TALKING ABOUT DESKTOP SCREEN READERS!

First things first: you need to know [why screen readers are so crucial for accessibility testing](/part--knowledge-about-accessibility---introduction/chapter--introduction-to-desktop-screen-reader-usage---overview/why-screen-readers-are-so-important-to-accessibility-testing){.page title="Why screen readers are so important to accessibility testing"} and which (of the nearly endless number of) [combinations of browsers and screen readers](/part--knowledge-about-accessibility---introduction/chapter--introduction-to-desktop-screen-reader-usage---overview/relevant-combinations-of-screen-readers-and-browsers){.page title="Relevant combinations of screen readers and browsers"} are important to care about.

We begin by explaining that [screen readers are one-dimensional](/part--knowledge-about-accessibility---introduction/chapter--introduction-to-desktop-screen-reader-usage---overview/screen-readers-are-sequential){.page title="Screen readers are sequential"} - meaning that they announce content and semantics in a linear way, while [visual attributes aren't conveyed](/part--knowledge-about-accessibility---introduction/chapter--introduction-to-desktop-screen-reader-usage---overview/screen-readers-dont-convey-visual-attributes){.page title="Screen readers don't convey visual attributes"} in any way!

This is followed by an introduction to [screen reader interaction modes](/part--knowledge-about-accessibility---introduction/chapter--introduction-to-desktop-screen-reader-usage---overview/screen-reader-interaction-modes){.page title="Screen reader interaction modes"}, and why [screen reader keyboard shortcuts](/part--knowledge-about-accessibility---introduction/chapter--introduction-to-desktop-screen-reader-usage---overview/screen-readers-are-keyboard-shortcut-monsters){.page title="Screen readers are keyboard shortcut monsters"} feel so nasty.

You then first learn [how to read websites using a screen reader](/part--knowledge-about-accessibility---introduction/chapter--introduction-to-desktop-screen-reader-usage---overview/how-to-read-websites-using-a-desktop-screen-reader){.page title="How to read websites using a desktop screen reader"}, and then [how to interact with them](/part--knowledge-about-accessibility---introduction/chapter--introduction-to-desktop-screen-reader-usage---overview/how-to-interact-with-websites-using-a-desktop-screen-reader){.page title="How to interact with websites using a desktop screen reader"}.

While you certainly have to know your tools to create accessible websites, it's no witchcraft. Here we show off the [basic rules of implementing screen reader ready websites](/part--knowledge-about-accessibility---introduction/chapter--introduction-to-desktop-screen-reader-usage---overview/how-to-implement-screen-reader-ready-websites){.page title="How to implement screen reader ready websites"}.

Finally, we admit that they can be frustrating pieces of software - so here's our attempt of explaining [how screen readers work (and why they seem so buggy)](/part--knowledge-about-accessibility---introduction/chapter--introduction-to-desktop-screen-reader-usage---overview/how-screen-readers-work---and-why-they-seem-so-buggy){.page title="How screen readers work - and why they seem so buggy"}.
