# Firefox browser: installation and configuration

![Firefox logo](_media/firefox-logo.png){.image}

For development, Firefox in combination with NVDA is the best choice:

- It's a quite stable combination
- It has the best support for HTML and ARIA standards
- Etc. (TODO)

We recommend to use this combination constantly when developing websites. But be sure to test your stuff also on the other relevant combinations of browsers and screen readers!

For more info, see [Relevant combinations of screen readers and browsers](/knowledge-about-developing-and-testing-accessible-websites/introduction-to-desktop-screen-reader-usage/relevant-combinations-of-screen-readers-and-browsers){.page}.
