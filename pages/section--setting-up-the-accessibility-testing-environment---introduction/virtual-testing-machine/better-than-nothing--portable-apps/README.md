# Better than nothing: portable apps

You don't have the rights to install new software, so running a virtual machine is not an option? Or you simply don't have the time to it? 

You can get both NVDA and Firefox (the most important combination of browser and screen reader for developers, see [Relevant combinations of screen readers and browsers](/knowledge-about-developing-and-testing-accessible-websites/introduction-to-desktop-screen-reader-usage/relevant-combinations-of-screen-readers-and-browsers){.page}) here ready-to-use executables here:

- NVDA can be run without the need to install it: [NVDA download](https://www.nvaccess.org/download/)
- Firefox can be downloaded as portable app: [Firefox portable download](https://portableapps.com/de/apps/internet/firefox_portable)

Remember though: JAWS and Internet Explorer 11 is still the most important combination of browser and screen reader. So in the end using the portable versions mentioned on this page isn't a final solution and you will need to find a way to test your websites in the other relevant combinations of browsers and screen readers, too!
