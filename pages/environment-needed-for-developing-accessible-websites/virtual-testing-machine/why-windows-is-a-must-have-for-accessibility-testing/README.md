# Why Windows is a must-have for accessibility testing

Most users with special needs are using Windows specific assistive software (see [Relevant combinations of screen readers and browsers](/knowledge-about-developing-and-testing-accessible-websites/introduction-to-desktop-screen-reader-usage/relevant-combinations-of-screen-readers-and-browsers){.page}).

- If you're not running Windows yourself, using a [virtual machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_machine) to run all the needed Windows tools is an obvious necessity
- Even if Windows is your used operating system already, we still advise you to run a dedicated Windows system inside a VM
    - This prevents possible disruption of your daily workflow, e.g. through an always talking synthesised screen reader voice (aggressively commenting everything you're doing at the moment)
