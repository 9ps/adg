# Getting a free Windows VM from modern.ie

![Modern.ie logo](_media/modernie-logo.png){.image}

The easiest way to get a Windows VM is downloading one from [modern.ie](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/tools/vms/).

# What is modern.ie?

It's a service provided by Microsoft for web developers in need to test different versions of Internet Explorer:

- All VMs from modern.ie are free and legal, as they will expire after some time period of around 90 days
    - If you're creating a snapshot of your VM's state before activating Windows online, you'll be able to reset the expiration as often as needed
- We suggest you download the VM `IE11 on Win7` as it can be re-activated a few times after expiration

# Default user and password

VMs from modern.ie have the following login credentials:

- User: `IEUser`
- Password: `Passw0rd!`

Note: VMs from modern.ie are set up with US-English keyboard layout. Therefore, the exclamation is triggered using `Shift + 1`.

If you want to change it, see: [Change your Windows password](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/14087/windows-7-change-your-windows-password).

## Setting your preferred keyboard layout

Be sure to change the VM's keyboard layout to your preferred one as described here: [How to change your keyboard layout](How to change your keyboard layout).

## Increasing performance and interoperability

- To increase performance, go to `Control Panel > System > Advanced Tab > Performance Settings`, then click on `Adjust for best performance` and `OK`
- To increase operability between the VM and your operating system, install VMware Tools: `Virtual Machine > VMware Tools Installation`
