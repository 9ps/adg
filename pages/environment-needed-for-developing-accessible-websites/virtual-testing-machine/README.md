# TL;DR - Too long, didn't read

First you'll want to know [why Windows is a must-have](/environment-needed-for-developing-accessible-websites/virtual-testing-machine/why-windows-is-a-must-have-for-accessibility-testing){.page title="Why Windows is a must-have for accessibility testing"} when it comes to accessibility testing, and why it's sensible to run it in its own virtual machine.

Then you will be pleasantly surprised that [you can download a free and legal copy of Windows](/environment-needed-for-developing-accessible-websites/virtual-testing-machine/getting-a-free-windows-vm-from-modern-ie){.page title="Getting a free Windows VM from modern.ie"} from modern.ie (running for 90 days, but resettable endlessly).

In the upcoming pages you'll learn how to run the virtual machine using either [VMware Fusion (macOS)](/environment-needed-for-developing-accessible-websites/virtual-testing-machine/configuring-vmware-fusion--macos--for-accessibility-testing){.page title="Configuring VMware Fusion (macOS) for accessibility testing"} or [VMware Workstation Player](/environment-needed-for-developing-accessible-websites/virtual-testing-machine/configuring-vmware-workstation-player--win--linux--for-accessibility-testing){.page title="Configuring VMware Workstation Player (Win, Linux) for accessibility testing"}; and if you're on a low budget, there's also some info about using it in [VirtualBox](/environment-needed-for-developing-accessible-websites/virtual-testing-machine/configuring-virtualbox-for-accessibility-testing){.page title="Configuring VirtualBox for accessibility testing"}.

Why install and configure all needed tools yourself? If you ask nicely, you can simply [get our pre-configured accessibility testing vm](/environment-needed-for-developing-accessible-websites/virtual-testing-machine/pre-configured-virtual-machine){.page title="Pre-configured virtual machine"}!

Finally, if you don't have the rights to install new software (or simply don't have the time to), you can get [portable versions of some of the most important apps](/environment-needed-for-developing-accessible-websites/virtual-testing-machine/better-than-nothing--portable-apps){.page title="Better than nothing: portable apps"}.
