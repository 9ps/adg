In this section, the installation and configuration of the most important browsers is described.

Before you proceed, be sure to read [Relevant combinations of screen readers and browsers](/knowledge-about-developing-and-testing-accessible-websites/introduction-to-desktop-screen-reader-usage/relevant-combinations-of-screen-readers-and-browsers){.page}!

# TL;DR - Too long, didn't read

First we describe how to [install and configure Internet Explorer 11](/environment-needed-for-developing-accessible-websites/web-browsers/internet-explorer-11--ie11--browser--installation-and-configuration){.page title="Internet Explorer 11 (IE11) browser: installation and configuration"}, our developers' longtime nightmare (which doesn't leave us alone even in terms regarding accessibility).

This is followed by a description of how to [install and configure Firefox](/environment-needed-for-developing-accessible-websites/web-browsers/firefox-browser--installation-and-configuration){.page title="Firefox browser: installation and configuration"}, our sympathetic fellow.

Later on, we talk about how to [install and configure Chrome](/environment-needed-for-developing-accessible-websites/web-browsers/chrome-browser--installation-and-configuration){.page title="Chrome browser: installation and configuration"} that isn't as important, but offers a lot of cool features and add-ons.

Finally, we show our [list of bookmarks and bookmarklets](/environment-needed-for-developing-accessible-websites/web-browsers/bookmarks-and-bookmarklets){.page title="Bookmarks and bookmarklets"} that every developer should have at hand!
