# Chrome browser: installation and configuration

![Chrome logo](_media/chrome-logo.png){.image}

Though Chrome has its own official screen reader add-on [ChromeVox](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/chromevox/kgejglhpjiefppelpmljglcjbhoiplfn), it's not widely used and thus not relevant in these terms.

But it's the most spread browser in the web developer community, and it offers some great add-ons.

For more info, see [Relevant combinations of screen readers and browsers](/knowledge-about-developing-and-testing-accessible-websites/introduction-to-desktop-screen-reader-usage/relevant-combinations-of-screen-readers-and-browsers){.page}.
