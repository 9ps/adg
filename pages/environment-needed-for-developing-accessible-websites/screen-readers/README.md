In this section, the installation and configuration of the most important desktop screen readers is described.

Before you proceed, be sure to read [Relevant combinations of screen readers and browsers](/knowledge-about-developing-and-testing-accessible-websites/introduction-to-desktop-screen-reader-usage/relevant-combinations-of-screen-readers-and-browsers){.page}!

By the way: If you want to learn how to use screen readers, head over to [Introduction to desktop screen reader usage](/knowledge-about-developing-and-testing-accessible-websites/introduction-to-desktop-screen-reader-usage){.page}!

# TL;DR - Too long, didn't read

First we describe how to [install and configure NVDA](/environment-needed-for-developing-accessible-websites/screen-readers/nvda-screen-reader--installation-and-configuration){.page title="NVDA screen reader: installation and configuration"}, our best friend when developing accessible websites.

This is followed by a description of how to [install and configure JAWS](/environment-needed-for-developing-accessible-websites/screen-readers/jaws-screen-reader--installation-and-configuration){.page title="JAWS screen reader: installation and configuration"} - a less pleasant fellow, but sadly the most widely used screen reader on earth.

We then also introduce a few [less important screen readers](/environment-needed-for-developing-accessible-websites/screen-readers/less-relevant-screen-readers){.page title="Less relevant screen readers"}, that still do play a role every now and then.

Finally, we talk about [mobile screen readers](/environment-needed-for-developing-accessible-websites/screen-readers/mobile-screen-readers){.page title="Mobile screen readers"} (which are built right into smartphones).
