# Introduction to mobile screen reader usage

**TODO**

VoiceOver/iOS doesn't offer a table navigation (horizontal/vertical) like NVDA. You can jump from table to table (rotor), but not e.g. vertically from cell to cell. But additionally you can use the touch screen to navigate a table (if you know where the table is on the screen). VoiceOver/iOS announces table headers correctly (horizontally and vertically) => what about multiple header cells and colspan/rowspan?

## Additional notes

- Mobile SR much easier to use:
    - Only 1 interaction mode
    - Built into OS
    - (But ARIA support less good.)
- Mirroring iOS screen on desktop
    - QuickTime (OSX)
    - [LonelyScreen](http://eu.lonelyscreen.com/index.html) (free)
    - [AirServer](http://www.airserver.com/) (commercial)
    - [Reflector](http://www.airsquirrels.com/reflector/) (commercial)
- Mirroring Android screen on desktop
    - [Vysor](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/vysor/gidgenkbbabolejbgbpnhbimgjbffefm)
- Should we also provide instructions on how to use a mobile screen reader??
    - How to activate/deactivate
    - Shortcut for activating/deactivating VoiceOver
    - Suspending TalkBack
    - Shortcut for starting TalkBack (no stop though)
    - Speech output display in TalkBack
    - Gestures
    - Rotor (iOS)
    - Keyboard (incl. fast typing by leaving a finger on the screen in iOS)
- No table navigation in mobile screen readers?!
