# What accessibility and usability have in common

**TODO**



## Additional notes

- Accessibility improves usability a lot
- In a few cases, accessibility declines usability for certain users, e.g. when the usage of fancy widgets (like Select2) isn't possible
    - The problem isn't accessibility but the inaccessibility of the used widgets
    - In such cases a user switch can be used: [How to determine a user's input and output devices](/knowledge/how-to-determine-a-users-input-and-output-devices)
