# The cursor (or: where am I?)

**When browsing websites using a screen reader**

When a mobile screen reader is running, a cursor (distinctive border) is painted around the current element.

In VoiceOver/iOS it looks like this:

![VoiceOver/iOS cursor](_media/voiceover-ios-cursor.png)

In Talkback it looks like this:

![Talkback cursor](_media/talkback-cursor.png)

This is somewhat similar to the focus of traditional browsers; in fact, when the screen reader cursor reaches a focusable element, its focus state is triggered (in the screenshots above, the dotted line around the link indicates its focus state). But while the browser focus can only be set to focusable elements (like links or form elements), the screen reader's cursor reaches all elements on the website, for example plain text paragraphs:
