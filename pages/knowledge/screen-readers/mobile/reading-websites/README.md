# How to read websites using a mobile screen reader

**For a sighted person, it's hard to imagine how a screen reader user surfs the internet. For a web developer with accessibility in mind, it's crucial to have a basic knowledge about this topic. So be ready to get a concrete idea of the main strategies available to read a website using a mobile screen reader!**

## Opening a website

We advise you to activate your mobile screen reader only when reading and interacting with a web page. For anything else (like entering an URL into the browser's address bar) we advise you to deactivate it temporarily. As soon as the web page has loaded, start your screen reader again.

- For VoiceOver/iOS, use the accessibility shortcut by tripple clicking the Home button (if you haven't done this yet, go back and read [VoiceOver/iOS configuration](/setup/screen-readers/voiceover-ios/)).
- For Talkback, (???is there a shortcut meanwhile???).

## Reading through a document

### Swiping

The standard way to read through a document is to move the screen reader cursor from element to element:

- To navigate from one element to the next one, swipe with one finger to the right.
- To navigate to the previous one, swipe with one finger to the left.

### Pointing

You can set the cursor to any element on the screen by clicking on it. Advanced mobile screen reader users often know exactly where the elements are displayed on their screen and access them quickly this way.

This behaviour usually is confusing to new users, as they expect that pointing on an element would activate (click) it.

### Scanning

If you move your finger over the touch screen, any element below your finger will receive the cursor. This is a good way to scan the screen and browse for elements.

## Rotor (iOS)

The rotor is a quickly accessible menu which offers more ways to interact with VoiceOver/iOS. To use it, rotate two fingers on your screen as if you're turning a dial. VoiceOver/iOS will announce the current setting; if you want to hear more settings, keep rotating your fingers until you found the one you need. To interacht with the current setting, swipe up or down with one finger.

Some of the settings that prove to be useful in daily accessibility testing are:

- Speech rate: increase or decrease.
- Container/headings/characters/words: move the cursor to the next or previous corresponding element.
- Language: toggle through available languages (for example, if a website has a wrong or missing `lang` attribute).

## ??? (Talkback)

TODO: Is there anything similar for Talkback?
