# Mobile screen readers

**Mobile screen readers are easy to understand and control. They offer a quick and pretty robust way of testing websites on accessibility, revealing many potential accessibility issues. As they are pre-installed on any modern smartphone and do not require a lot of configuration, they are pragmatic testing tools at call - especially for beginners.**

Mobile screen readers are controlled using pointing and gestures on the touch screen. While there are pretty advanced gestures for some native applications, fortunately the interaction with websites is surprisingly easy.
