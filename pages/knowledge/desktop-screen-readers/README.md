First things first: you need to know [why screen readers are so crucial for accessibility testing](/knowledge/desktop-screen-readers/what-and-why) and which (of the nearly endless number of) [combinations of browsers and screen readers](/knowledge/desktop-screen-readers/relevant-combos) are important to care about.

We begin by explaining that [screen readers process contents in a linear way](/knowledge/desktop-screen-readers/linear-processing), meaning that they announce content and semantics sequentially, one piece of information after the other. Also, [visual attributes aren't conveyed](/knowledge/desktop-screen-readers/no-visual-attributes) in any way!

This is followed by an introduction to [screen reader interaction modes](/knowledge/desktop-screen-readers/browse-focus-modes), and why [screen reader keyboard shortcuts](/knowledge/desktop-screen-readers/shortcut-monsters) feel so nasty.

You then first learn [how to read websites using a screen reader](/knowledge/desktop-screen-readers/reading-websites), and then [how to interact with them](/knowledge/desktop-screen-readers/interacting-with-websites).

While you certainly need to know your tools to create accessible websites, it is no witchcraft. Here you get acquainted with the [basic rules of implementing screen reader ready websites](/knowledge/desktop-screen-readers/how-to-implement).

Finally, we admit that screen readers can be frustrating pieces of software - so here's our attempt of explaining [how screen readers work (and why they seem so buggy)](/knowledge/desktop-screen-readers/so-buggy).
