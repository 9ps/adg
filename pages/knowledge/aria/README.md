**There are indeed situations where standard HTML doesn't provide functionalities for all the requirements developers may have for implementing modern and interactive websites.

In this chapter, we introduce how it is purposely used, show its potential and shortcomings as well as alternatives to it.**

Finally, we show [some typical gotchas when using ARIA](/knowledge/aria/bad-practices), something especially novices to ARIA should read attentively.
