Setting up a perfect environment for developing and testing testing accessibility needs quite some effort. Luckily, we can deliver you a copy of our own pre-configured accessibility testing virtual machine (VM): up to date, ready to be used, free - and legal, of course.

The VM offers all the [Screen readers](/setup/screen-readers),  [Web browsers](/setup/browsers), and  [Accessibility helper tools](/setup/helper-tools) described in our [Setup of the accessibility environment](/setup) section.

Please [](@page-49) and ask for the pre-configured VM.

## Legal note

We deliver a copy of a [modern.ie Virtual Machine](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/tools/vms/), enriched with free to use software and proper configuration.

The modern.IE VM comes with a license that allows free usage during 90 days. After launching the VM the first time, Windows will ask for activation. **Note:** if you create a snapshot before activation, you can rollback again and use the VM basically without any limit.

## You can't run a virtual machine?

You don't have the rights to install new software, so running a virtual machine is not an option?

You can get portable versions of some of the most important apps here: [](@page-96).

## Additional notes

Dies ist k√∂nnte rechtlich problematisch sein, siehe <https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/244472/modern-ie-vm-license>.
