# Windows operating system

**To ensure the accessibility of websites, the most important software is native Windows software, such as screen readers. In this chapter, you will learn how to prepare everything for the upcoming installation tasks. And if you want to keep your own Windows working environment clean (or if you aren't using Windows anyway), we suggest to set up a dedicated Windows installation within a virtual machine.**

## Additional notes

First you need to know [why Windows is required](/setup/windows/why) when it comes to ensuring accessibility of websites and why it is sensible to run it in its own virtual machine (VM).

Then you will be happy to hear that you can [download a pre-configured Windows VM](/setup/windows/modern-ie) directly from Microsoft's service Modern.IE (running for 90 days, but resettable endlessly).

Finally, in the following pages, you'll learn how to run the virtual machine using either [VMware Fusion (macOS)](/setup/windows/vmware-on-macos) or [VMware Workstation Player (Windows, Linux)](/setup/windows/vmware-on-windows-linux).
