**Talkback is the mobile screen reader of Android. It is pre-installed on Android devices, easy to understand, and the most used mobile screen reader in non-Western countries.**

## Display Speech Output

Displays the current announcement as text on screen. Very useful while developing! Sadly there's nothing like that in VoiceOver/iOS.
