# Less relevant screen readers

**TODO**

If possible, also test with:

- [VoiceOver](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VoiceOver#OS_X) (Mac OS X), which is deeply integrated into the operating system and thus offers a whole new user experience
- [Windows-Eyes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Window-Eyes) (Windows), another commonly used screen reader (especially in the US)
