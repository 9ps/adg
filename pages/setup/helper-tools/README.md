# Accessibility helper tools

**Beneath big players like screen readers and browsers (incl. extensions), there is a vast number of software that helps in developing accessible websites. In this chapter, you will find a collection of our favourite helper tools. Some of them are third party software, others are integrated into Windows.**

[Colour Contrast Analyser](/pages/setup/helper-tools/colour-contrast-analyser) helps to prevent low contrast between foreground and background elements.

[PDF Accessibility Checker](/pages/setup/helper-tools/pdf-accessibility-checker) helps in determining the accessibility of PDF documents.

[Windows High Contrast Mode](/pages/setup/helper-tools/high-contrast-mode) helps to make sure that all visual cues of a page are perceivable even with user defined colour schemes.

[TotalValidator](/pages/setup/helper-tools/totalvalidator) allows to scan webpages' source code for validity of different criteria.
