# How to use this guide

**This guide encompasses a huge amount of knowledge about various topics of both theoretical and practical nature, all of which are highly relevant to developing accessible websites.**

The content in its entirety is the result of many years of hands-on practice in the field of auditing websites for accessibility (and helping to optimise them), as well as developing accessible websites. It emerged from the daily experience of user experts with special needs, blended together with the profound technical knowledge of fullstack web developers.

## How to read and work through this guide

**TODO**

To people wanting to learn about accessibility, this guide aims to provide a comprehensive resource for both:

- Beginners looking for a pragmatic to dive into the world of accessibility.
- Seasoned experts wanting to extend their knowledge and searching for new inspirations.

To get the most out of this guide, let us explain to you how to use it best.

### Language

This guide is written in a rather shorthand and technical English, so good knowledge of [HTML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML), [CSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets), [JavaScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript) and commonly used browser technologies is assumed.

### Structure

Inspired by the layout of traditional books, we worked hard to give this guide a sensible structure.

1. The top level elements are called **parts**. You are currently in the part titled "Introduction to this guide". In navigations, short titles are used to save space and enhance skim reading; the current part's short title is "Introduction".
2. Every part contains several **chapters**. You are currently in the chapter titled "How to read and work through this guide"; its short title is "Read".
3. Every chapter contains several **pages** (and sometimes even sub pages). You are currently on the page titled "How to contribute to this guide"; its short title is "Contribute".

### Browsing vs. full read

The contents of this guide consequentially build up on each other. So we highly recommend you to start reading from the very beginning, then make your way continuously through the guide. Use the **previous** and **next** links on the bottom to do so.

Alas, internal links between different contents are provided sparingly.

However, we tried our best to make the individual content elements als self-standing and self-explanatory as possible. This allows you to browse them on their own. Use the navigation to quickly access different contents.
