# How to read and work through this guide

**TODO**

To people wanting to learn about accessibility, this guide aims to provide a comprehensive resource for both:

- Beginners looking for a pragmatic to dive into the world of accessibility.
- Seasoned experts wanting to extend their knowledge and searching for new inspirations.

To get the most out of this guide, let us explain to you how to use it best.

## Language

This guide is written in a rather shorthand and technical English, so good knowledge of [HTML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML), [CSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets), [JavaScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript) and commonly used browser technologies is assumed.

## Structure

Inspired by the layout of traditional books, we worked hard to give this guide a sensible structure.

1. The top level elements are called **parts**. You are currently in the part titled "Introduction to this guide". In navigations, short titles are used to save space and enhance skim reading; the current part's short title is "Introduction".
2. Every part contains several **chapters**. You are currently in the chapter titled "How to read and work through this guide"; its short title is "Read".
3. Every chapter contains several **pages** (and sometimes even sub pages). You are currently on the page titled "How to contribute to this guide"; its short title is "Contribute".

## Browsing vs. full read

The contents of this guide consequentially build up on each other. So we highly recommend you to start reading from the very beginning, then make your way continuously through the guide. Use the **previous** and **next** links on the bottom to do so.

Alas, internal links between different contents are provided sparingly.

However, we tried our best to make the individual content elements als self-standing and self-explanatory as possible. This allows you to browse them on their own. Use the navigation to quickly access different contents.

## Additional notes

"While you can copy&paste the codes from our examples into your projects, be aware that they may need additional optimisations regarding your audience" -> Hinweis von Anton, dass gewisse Beispiele nicht 100% zugänglich sind (und dies aber m.E. auch nicht sein müssen).
