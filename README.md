# Welcome to the Accessibility Developer Guide!

The «Accessibility Developer Guide» (ADG) is an initiative of [«Access for all»](http://access-for-all.ch/), Swiss foundation for technology adapted to people with disabilities.

It is developed and maintained in collaboration with a number of acclaimed web agencies. The intent behind the ADG is to bridge the gap between providers of websites and users with special needs.

It aims to provide a comprehensive resource for both beginners looking for a pragmatic way to dive into the world of accessibility, as well as seasoned experts wanting to extend their knowledge and embracing new inspirations.
